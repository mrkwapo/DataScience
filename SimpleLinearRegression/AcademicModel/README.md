# Simple Linear Regression Machine Learning Model

This Simple Linear Regression Machine Learning Model shows that a correlation between SAT scores and expected GPAs. A college scholarship program can use this model to predict the chance of a student maintaining a GPA score of 3.0 or better based on the student's SAT score. 

Below is a visualization of Machine Learning test results based on a #dataset containing student SAT scores and GPA.
